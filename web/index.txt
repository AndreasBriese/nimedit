NimEdit is the upcoming slim IDE / editor for Nim. Written from scratch
in Nim, it can be scripted with NimScript. Scripting is seen as the solution
to avoid feature creep.

Its design is minimalistic and yet it is one of the most powerful
editors out there. Once you tried it for a while, you cannot go
back to other tools.


Features
========

* Nimsuggest integration.
* Scriptable with `NimScript <docs/editor.html>`_.
* Attached console; NimEdit works with every build tool out of the box!
* Keyboard centric design.
* Smart word wrap, horizontal scrolling is a thing of the past.
* A **minimap** showing you where you are in a long function.
