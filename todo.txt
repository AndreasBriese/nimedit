TODO:
 - 'save as' doesn't expand the filename
 - replace '+' does not work!!!
 - ligatures do not work properly
 - console doesn't filter .exe files properly
 - 'nim check' integration
 - add the option for semantic highlighting
 - the command history needs to be persistent (also for redirected programs!)
 - what is kept in the command history should be scriptable

 - on the fly search
 - regex search&replace
 - draw gradient for scrollbar
 - tabsize vs displaytabsize

Later versions:
 - debugger support!
   - have support for conditional breakpoints: only tell gdb about breakpoints
     after a special event! --> much better debugging than VS!
 - show which 'when' sections are active
 - large file handling

 - control+w marks the current word, then string, then string with quotes,
   then AST subtree, then walks up the tree.
 - separate view
   - introduce a "legend" feature

Optional:
 - make replace scriptable
 - simple refactorings: rename
 - highlighting of substring occurences
Optimizations:
 - cache font renderings



Font rendering
--------------

Windows now uses Consolas by default, and will give better results when
using Direct Write.
Improved sub-pixel positioning on OS X, matching Core Text output.
Linux now uses Pango, giving better results for unicode text.
