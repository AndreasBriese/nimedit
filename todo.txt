Font rendering
--------------

Windows now uses Consolas by default, and will give better results when
using Direct Write.
Improved sub-pixel positioning on OS X, matching Core Text output.
Linux now uses Pango, giving better results for unicode text.
Rendering of rulers, line highlights and misspellings has been improved.
